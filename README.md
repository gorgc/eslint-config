# @tgarif/eslint-config

- Single quotes, semi
- Auto fix for formatting (aimed to be used standalone without Prettier)
- TypeScript, Vue, React out-of-box
- Lint also for JSON, YAML, markdown
- Sorted imports, dangling commas for cleaner commit diff
- Reasonable defaults, best practices, only one line of config
